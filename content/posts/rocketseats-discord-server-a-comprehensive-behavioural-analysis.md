# How it all started
I've always heard that Rocketseat had a bad reputation from my friends, that made me really question myself why, upon reviewing their YouTube channel where they would publish simple tutorials/guides about web frameworks/technologies I realized that they wanted to help the web development community in some way or another, 

# Talking Discord
I also realized a pattern between the time of day, late at night, specific groups of people would join the Discord server and discuss about something, also there is a specific group of people that frequently visit their Discord channels. Most of the times, there is at least one person sharing their screen on any of their Discord channels.

Peak of users in voice channels are outside of the work hours

# Data Analysis
This is not about how they claim to know certain languages/technologies, this is about how many people are actually using those languages/technologies in real-world situations by seeing their screens being shared on Discord.
